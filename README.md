# mele-a200-Debian-Stretch

Note: Debian stretch armmp kernel fully support this TV-box (except the Mali), 
it works with sun5i-a10s-olinuxino-micro.dts, only a few minor warning due to the hardware difference.

Here provide the original FEX from android firmware and corresponding dts file,
and example 5.0.y kernel configuration.
The display on HDMI works fine, kernel command line argument should refer to those sunxi device in Armbian.
